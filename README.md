## CSGO Account Website Base

I made this site originally under private commission, since it was never completed I had finally decided to release the source publicly.

It uses Sanity for item information to sell on the site, and also was originally setup for Stripe.JS, however I did not end up finishing that.

Stack:
NodeJS (14.0)
NextJS
Tailwind
Sanity
Stripe
